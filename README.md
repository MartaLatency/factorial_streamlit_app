# Factorial Calculator Streamlit App

A simple web application built with Streamlit that calculates the factorial of a given number.

## Features

- User-friendly interface
- Input validation
- Clear explanation of factorial calculation
- Error handling for invalid inputs
- Responsive design

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/factorial_streamlit_app.git
cd factorial_streamlit_app
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

1. Run the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to the URL shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:8501)

3. Enter a number in the input field and click "Calculate Factorial" to see the result

## How it Works

The app calculates the factorial of a number using an iterative approach. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

For example:
- 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120
- 0! = 1 (by definition)
